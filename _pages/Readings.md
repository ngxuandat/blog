        - Some notes: At the beginning of my freshman year, I thought to myself that I will try to approach math in the most rigorous and technical way that I'm capable of. In the end, that did not work out very well so I changed to a more practical, application-based kind of learning, which basically means that I will just learn mathematics that I found necessary during the studies for other subjects, such as Graph theory, numerical analysis, etc. (quick notes: the application-based approach is only for the more advanced topics in math, I still think that the basic topics in undergrad math like Mathematical Thinking, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability, Logic, and Discrete should still be learned rigorously, and these were classes that I had to work really hard to finish)
