I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Economics. I'm interested in Behavioral Economics, Economic Networks, Machine Learning and AI.

I'm an online learning addict and have a very broad interest. Here is a [graph/map](https://kumu.io/datnguyen/graph#tree-of-knowledge) of all the things that I'm interested in. It the same with the **graph** I embeded below as a preview.
